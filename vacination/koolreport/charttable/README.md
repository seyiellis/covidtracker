## Installation

3. Reference to the ChartTable widget by the classname`\koolreport\charttable\ChartTable`

## Requirement

Since version 1.1.0, `ChartTable` no longer requires the `Inputs`, `DataGrid`, or `Chartjs` packages to be installed as well.

## Usage

### ChartTable

To use `ChartTable` you only need to define its `dataSource` property.

```
\koolreport\charttable\ChartTable::create(array(
    "name" => "charttable1",
    "dataSource" => $this->dataStore('myDatastore')
));
```

#### Properties

|name|type|default|description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`name`|string||Optional. You can set the name for your charttable if you want to refer to the table later on at client-side. If you don't set we will set random name for table|
|`dataSource`|DataStore|| Specify a dataStore, an array or a function that data table will get data from|
|`columns`|Array||Optional. Set charttable's columns instead of using its datastore's columns|
